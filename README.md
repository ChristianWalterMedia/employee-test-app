# Employee App

[Demo](https://master--inspiring-cucurucho-168555.netlify.app)

### How to start
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
4. Run `npm run serve`
5. Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser

### How to use
At startup you will see a list of employees. You can click on an employee to go to the details page, where you can "delete" the employee. After deleting, you have the possibility to return to the dashboard using the button. If you do not interact with the button within 10 seconds, you will be automatically redirected to the dashboard.
